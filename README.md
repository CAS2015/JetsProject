## OOP Hogwarts Stables (Jets Project)

### Description

This project models a Hogwarts stable with an assortment of brooms, magical
creatures and flying vehicles. The user can choose to fly objects from the
stable, feed the magical creatures, add their own objects, and much more.


### Topics and Technologies Used

Technologies used in this program:
* Abstract classes and methods
* Class Hierarchies
* Interfaces
* Collections (lists and arrays)
* Importing data from text files
* Casting and parsing data types
* Try/catches and error handling


### How to Run

Run the application. The user will be prompted with a menu of available
selections. After the selection is made and the user interaction is complete,
they will return to the main menu to make another selection or quit.


### Lessons Learned

For this project I made a UML diagram to illustrate the user interactions.
This made it pretty straight forward to code with minimal rework. Where I spent
a lot of my time was playing around with different ways to accomplish the tasks
or different places to put specific methods and how that affected the code. This
made it a really great learning experience and helped me figure out ways to make
my code more flexible or how to write it more efficiently.
